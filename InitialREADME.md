To many, a scientist is a person, often dressed in a white coat, that works
in laboratories, universities or hi-tech factories and doesn't have much to do with the
general public. Perhaps the scientists interact with people when explaining
a new discovery or why they should have more taxpayers' money but their
work is often abstract and not easily grasped by outsiders.

But how do we define a civilian, or citizen, who does scientific research
or work, but in a non-professional category? In modern times , the term
'citizen science' is used; indeed the Oxford English Dictionary has one
definition for citizen science:

i) scientific work undertaken by members of the general public, often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions.

or for the people who take part in the activity that are called citizen scientists:

ii) a member of the general public who engages in scientific work, often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions; an amateur scientist.

(The first use of the term in the modern sense came from a citizen science programme in 1989
to gather data on acid rain.)

While citizen science now covers a huge range of topics (see Zooniverse), this website will
concentrate mainly on astronomy. No need to run for the hills! Astronomy is something that has been
done by amateurs for many centuries and is a science I can describe some success in. We will
delve into the important discoveries my friends and I have made, while like me, they are 
pretty clueless about fundamental maths or physics. Who has not gazed up at the stars
and wondered what they are or how we came to be?

Within the website will be down-to-earth explanations an interviews with people
who have discovered new and important objects in space and have contributed
to citizen science in, for a start, the classification of a million galaxies. Pages will
touch on other varieties of citizen science and links will be given to relevant sites
readers might like to try themselves :)
