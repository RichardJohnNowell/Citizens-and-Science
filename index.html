Citizen Science For Everyone! seeks to inform the wider public about how they can add to scientific knowledge and why they might want to. This website will help demonstrate that science can be done by citizens, and their children, in many different situations. From examining a million galaxies to counting lions on the Serengeti, from monitoring woodburning stoves to describing the state of rivers, citizens can do science and be as good as professionals.

The idea of volunteering is central to the activities where people group together to perform tasks that paid scientists don't or can't do. The assembling of data through whatever means provides evidence that something exists or is happening. Citizen Science FOR Everyone! will give examples of successful projects and what can be achieved.
