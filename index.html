            To many, a scientist is a person, often dressed in a white coat, that works in laboratories, universities or hi-tech factories and doesn't have much to do with the general public. 
            Citizen Science is for Everyone! (CSifE!) seeks to inform the wider public about how they can add to scientific knowledge and why they might want to. This website will help demonstrate
            that science can be done by citizens, and their children, in many different situations. From examining a million galaxies to counting lions on the Serengetti, from monitoring woodburning 
            stoves to describing the state of rivers, citizens can do science and be as good as professionals.

              <div>
                  <p> The first use of the term in the modern sense is in 1989 in an article about acid rain: 225 volunteers were given basic measuring devices and were asked to collect data (see next page). The idea of volunteering is central to the activities where people group together to perform tasks that paid scientists don't or can't do. The assembling of data through whatever means provides evidence that something exists or is happening. Citizen Science For Everyone! will give example of successful projects and what can be achieved. The interviews page includes three people who have been active citizen scientists. The Activities page gives links to citizen science projects and has a quiz! The achievement page links to results from various studies and also has a quiz! The contacts page has a JotForm contact form if you want to ask questions. Enjoy! </p>
