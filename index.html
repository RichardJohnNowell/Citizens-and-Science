          To many, a scientist is a person, often dressed in a white coat, that works in laboratories, universities or hi-tech factories and doesn't have much to do with the general public. 
          Citizen Science is for Everyone! (CSifE!) seeks to inform the wider public about how they can add to scientific knowledge and why they might want to. This website will help demonstrate
          that science can be done by citizens, and their children, in many different situations. From examining a million galaxies to counting lions on the Serengetti, from monitoring woodburning 
          stoves to describing the state of rivers, citizens can do science and be as good as professionals.

          What is citizen science then? The first use of the term in the modern sense is in 1989 in an article about acid rain: 225 volunteers were given basic 
          measuring devices and were asked to collect data. The idea of volunteering is central to the activities where people group together to perform tasksthat paid scientists don't or can't do.
          The assembling of data through whatever means provides evidence that something exists or is happening. CSifE! will give example of successful projects and what can be achieved. 
          The interviews page includes three people who have been active citizen scientists. The achievment page will outline what has beenstudied while the activities page shows scientific 
          results. The newsletter and contact page can deliver up-to-date news. Enjoy!
