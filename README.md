## Introduction

Citizen science has been a part of my life since 2007 when I started taking part in
an astronomical crowdsourcing website called Galaxy Zoo (GZ). I didn't know much about astronomy
at that point, but through joining in the discussions on the GZ forum, I began to learn
a lot more about astronomy but also what citizen science was. By volunteering to
do scientific work such as classifying galaxies, I had become an amateur scientist! Indeed,
through the GZ website and its forum I became engaged with citizen science when I started
to discover objects and meet some of the scientists who were using the data that
hundreds of thousands of people had produced. Personally, I helped discover rare galaxies
and discovered 32 supernovae. Since 2007, there have not been many weeks that I have not
made some contribution to the process.

This website concentrates on educational resources for citizen science. There are links to example
projects, which include those who prefer to stay inside and participate
via a desktop (like myself) or those who want to get outside and get water samples,
for instance. There are links to academic studies for those who want to join in or who 
are sceptical about whether anything is worthwhile: as I explain, hard cash is used
to fund this scientific work.

## Expectations

Through this website, I hope to introduce people to what citizen science is and the activities
that can be taken part in by grown-ups and children. While readers aren't 
expected to sign-up to a project, a seed might be planted that can help on a
local, national or international collaboration. I spent a few years as 
teacher, so I know something about education and its challenges and rewards.
Please use the links: they will become very important when trying to
answer the three quizzes!

## Features
<!--- homepage --->

### Homepage

<div align="center">
        <a href="https://github.com/RichardJohnNowell/Citizens-and-Science/blob/main/assets/images/csfe-website-images/csfe-browser/csfe-browser-homepage.jpg?raw=true">
            <img src="https://github.com/RichardJohnNowell/Citizens-and-Science/blob/main/assets/images/csfe-website-images/csfe-browser/csfe-browser-homepage.jpg?raw=true" width="350" height="163" id="csfe-browser-homepage" title="csfe-browser-homepage" alt="csfe-browser-homepage">
        </a>
</div>

The homepage has image background of scientists working that has been
changed using an opacity effect. This is quite deliberate as it is
countered by images of citizen scientists, for example grandmothers
in Australia imaging wildlife found on coral reefs. These are
free, high resolution images which can be clicked on to see the full size.

The homepage will seek to introduce the reader to what citzen science is and where the
term comes from. It will pose questions such as:
<div align="left">
    <ul>
        <li>What is citizen science?
        </li>
        <li>Why should I be interested?
        </li>
        <li>It's not real science is it?
        </li>
        <li>How many people have taken part?
        </li>
        <li>Are there projects I can take part in?
        </li>
        <li>Is it just for adults or can children join in?
        </li>
    </ul>

<p>
I asked three friends I have got to know over the decades since 2007 and how they feel about CS.
Alice Sheppard works for University College London's geography dept. She is the community manager for the ExCiteS project and as such meets
a lot of interested people. I first met Alice through a series of social events for citizens as a result of Galaxy Zoo. Alice was the moderator
on the Galaxy Zoo forum and we took part in discovering rare
galaxies. In 2009, she even came to speak at my local astronomy club about it, an event that is still on YouTube.
</p>
<p>
Ine Theunissen-Limpens lives in the Netherlands and is mainly a supernovae
reporter. Indeed, such is Ine's skill in that task he has discovered
over 130 supernova so far on his own and is on course to become one of the
Galaxy Zoos' most prolific citizen scientists. While working within the Dutch health system,
Ine has done more discovering than many professional scientists ever will.
</p>
<p>
Christine Macmillan is a moderator on the present incarnation of
Galaxy Zoo and is someone I've also met up with. Her patience
is remarkable and she is always trying to help people become 
better astronomers and scientists. The present GZ attracts
a wide variety of people and is used by educational establishments.

</div>

<p>This page will introduce the reader to the astounding number and range
of different citizen science projects and includes a simple quiz to help people
decide what might suit them. From counting butterflies to
clearing marine plastic, from counting lions and ai pollution monitoring,
volunteers can and do make a difference. I've made contributions to
astronomy through citizen science and many other volunteers' results have
made their way into real published sceince. The two YouTube
videos can inform potential citizen scientists about what might be available.
Each are around 5 or 6 minutes long.</p>

This page demonstrates that citizens
can do real science and the results can be scientifically worthwhile.
As the opening paragraph points out, if citizen science didn't produce 
scientifically-accepted results, then no-one would use it. Money
is spent producing these studies because the results have been
demontrated time and again. The one YouTube video shows
how CS can effect ordinary people. Featured is Dutch schoolteacher Hanny van Arkel
who is a friend who I have met with several times. She discovered
a rare astronomical object which is named after her- "Hanny's Voorwerp". 
People generally get something out of which ever project they use, though
having a voorwerp named after you is very special.

        </a>
</div>

The contacts page has a quiz that takes the user via a link
to the Wikipedia article "Citizen Science". This is a large article and the quiz is difficult,
which is a good way to introduce people to the larger picture. Also, it is hoped to introduce users to the many
different types of citizen science and some of its history.

There is also a Jotform should you wish to enquire more about any aspect of the website.

<!--- testing --->
    
## Testing
The website was assembled using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6. I used the desktop program Microsoft VS code and online Gitpod. I used Gitpod
a lot more this time than in the previous project for clarity and to practise in a more professional setting. The website was continously tested during
its build with W3 validations, PageSpeed Insights and JSHint. No AI was used in the construction of the code.

Code Beautify was used to tidy code and helped reveal poorly-executed code. The website was viewed with several android phones, Windows 10 laptops, an iPad and 
a 24" separate desktop screen. Three browsers Firefox, Chrome and MS Edge were checked. My DELL AIO desktop has an up-to-date Linux Ubuntu OS with a 24" screen. 
This displayed the images well, though some of the styling looked odd.

With the code at the present time, no bugs were found. Performance suffered on the pages with embedded YouTube links. All links were found to work using
the buttons provided. The 3 quizzes have 5 questions each with 3 possible choices. The quizzes worked and rejected wrong answers or invalid input. 
The pass mark was set to 4 out of 5, but this is easily changed as can the questions.
        
<!--- end of testing --->
<!--- deployment --->
        
## Deployment

The website was deployed on the 16th April 2023 using GitHub pages. The site was found to be responsive and all links worked, including the image links to 
the data hosting site. Wireframes and development images were used to tweak layout, while two YouTube video links and four pictures that were found to reduce 
performance were removed. The Google fonts link were successful. Bootstrap framework for flex-containers and buttons worked well. Font Awesome supplied the 
icons using a v6.4 kit. CSS styling linked through GitHub worked as did the scripts. The Jotform contact form worked and users have submitted messages.
        
<!--- end of deployment --->
<!--- validation --->
   
## Validation
   
Validation was used from the W3 html and css validation websites, while JavaScript was tested using JS Hint (screenshots below). Pagespeed Insights was 
used to test for accessibility for each page using mobile and desktop results. All pages cleared accessibility tests on mobiles and desktops, each scoring 100.

## Wireframes

Fifteen wireframes were made using the website Balsamiq. They show images for an iPhone, desktop browser and iPad. Six are shown below. As can be seen, 
while some pages have not changed much, others have lost videos or images, mainly for performance issues. Indeed the title has changed and lost the 'is' for brevity.
<p>Pictures can be clicked on for full size.</p>
