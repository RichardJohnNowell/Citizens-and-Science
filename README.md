## Introduction

Citizen science has been a part of my life since 2007 when I started taking part in
an astronomical crowdsourcing website called Galaxy Zoo (GZ). I didn't know much about astronomy
at that point, but through joining in the discussions on the GZ forum, I began to learn
a lot more about astronomy but also what citizen science was. By volunteering to
do scientific work such as classifying galaxies, I had become an amateur scientist! Indeed,
through the GZ website and its forum I became engaged with citizen science when I started
to discover objects and meet some of the scientists who were using the data that
hundreds of thousands of people had produced. Personally, I helped discover rare galaxies
and discovered 32 supernovae. Since 2007, there have not been many weeks that I have not
made some contribution to the process.

This website concentrates on educational resources for citizen science. There are links to example
projects, which include those who prefer to stay inside and participate
via a desktop (like myself) or those who want to get outside and get water samples,
for instance. There are links to academic studies for those who want to join in or who 
are sceptical about whether anything is worthwhile: as I explain, hard cash is used
to fund this scientific work.

<!--- user expectations --->

## Expectations

Through this website, I hope to introduce people to what citizen science is and the activities
that can be taken part in by grown-ups and children. While readers aren't 
expected to sign-up to a project, a seed might be planted that can help on a
local, national or international collaboration. I spent a few years as 
teacher, so I know something about education and its challenges and rewards.
Please use the links: they will become very important when trying to
answer the three quizzes!

    </ul>
</div>
<p> The colour scheme is based around a blue colour and complimentary colours, as below:</p>
<div align="center">

## Features
<!--- homepage --->

### Homepage
<div align="center">
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RichardJohnNowell/Citizens-and-Science/main/assets/C%26S_Final_Website_images/ CSFE_Tablet_Size/iPad_Pro_Homepage.jpg">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RichardJohnNowell/Citizens-and-Science/main/assets/C%26S_Final_Website_images/CSFE_Tablet_Size/iPad_Pro_Homepage.jpg" width="350" height="505" id="iPad_Pro_Homepage" title="iPad_Pro_Homepage" alt="iPad_Pro_Homepage">
        </a>
</div>
The homepage has image background of scientists working that has been
changed using an opacity effect. This is quite deliberate as it is
countered by images of citizen scientists, for example grandmothers
in Australia imaging wildlife found on coral reefs. These are
free, high resolution images which can be clicked on to see the full size.

The homepage will seek to introduce the reader to what citzen science is and where the
term comes from. It will pose questions such as:
<div align="left">
    <ul>
        <li>What is citizen science?
        </li>
        <li>Why should I be interested?
        </li>
        <li>It's not real science is it?
        </li>
        <li>How many people have taken part?
        </li>
        <li>Are there projects I can take part in?
        </li>
        <li>Is it just for adults or can children join in?
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<!--- interviews --->

### Interviews

<div align="center">
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RichardJohnNowell/Citizens-and-Science/main/assets/C%26S_Final_Website_images/CSFE_Tablet_Size/iPad_Pro_Interviews_page.jpg">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RichardJohnNowell/Citizens-and-Science/main/assets/C%26S_Final_Website_images/CSFE_Tablet_Size/iPad_Pro_Interviews_page.jpg" width="350" height="539" id="iPad_Pro_Interviews" title="iPad_Pro_Interviews" alt="iPad_Pro_Interviews">
        </a>
</div>
<p>
I asked three friends I have got to know over the decades since 2007 and how they feel about CS.
Alice Sheppard works for University College London's geography dept. She is the community lead for the EXCITe project and as such meets
a lot of interested people. I first met Alice through a series of social events for citizens as a result of Galaxy Zoo. Alice was the moderator
on the Galaxy Zoo forum and we took part in discovering rare
galaxies. In 2009, she even came to speak at my local astronomy club about it, an event that is still on YouTube.
</p>
<p>
Ine Theunissen lives in the Netherlands and is mainly a supernovae
reporter. Indeed, such is Ine's skill in that task he has discovered
over 130 supernova so far on his own and is on course to become one of the
Galaxy Zoos' most prolific citizen scientists. While working within the Dutch health system,
Ine has done more discovering than many professional scientists ever  will.
</p>
<p>
Christine Macmillan is a moderator on the present incarnation of
Galaxy Zoo and is someone I've also met up with. Her patience
is remarkable and she is always trying to help people become 
better astronomers and scientists. The present GZ attracts
a wide variety of people and is used by educational establishments.

</div>

This page will introduce the reader to the astounding number and range
of different CS projects and includes a simple quiz to help people
decide what might suit them. From counting butterflies to
clearing marine plastic, from counting lions and ai pollution monitoring,
volunteers can and do make a difference. I've made contributions to
astronomy through CS and many other volunteers' results have
made their way into real published sceince. The two YouTube
videos can inform potential citizen scientists about what might be available.
Each are around 5 or 6 minutes long.

The 8 citizen science projects are:
<div align="left">
    <ol>
        <li>The Bristol Approach: what is citizen sensing?
        </li>
        <li>Ocean Cleanup, part of the growing organisation to cleanup plastic waste from marine environments.
        </li>
        <li>SciStarter is a portal that lists hundreds of possible projects to take part in.
        </li>
        <li>UK center for Ecology and Hydrology has smartphone apps.
        </li>
        <li>The National Geographic site contains examples of popular projects.
        </li>
        <li>The Conservation Volunteers website is based in Scotland and has projects like "HogWatch Scotland".
        </li>
        <li>The Wildlife Trust website has a multitude of projects, some of which might be suitable for youngsters.
        </li>
        <li>Good nature: citizen science trips and holidays in the UK (The Guardian).
        </li>
    </ol>

        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RichardJohnNowell/Citizens-and-Science/main/assets/C%26S_Final_Website_images/CSFE_Tablet_Size/iPad_Pro_Achievements_page.jpg">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RichardJohnNowell/Citizens-and-Science/main/assets/C%26S_Final_Website_images/CSFE_Tablet_Size/iPad_Pro_Achievements_page.jpg" width="350" height="508" id="iPad_Pro_Achievements" title="iPad_Pro_Achievements" alt="iPad_Pro_Achievements">
        </a>
</div>
A somewhat specialist page that demonstrates that citizens
can do real science and the results can be scientifically worthwhile.
As the opening paragraph points out, if citizen science didn't produce 
scientifically-accepted results, then no-one would use it. Money
is spent producing these studies because the results have been
demontrated time and again. The one YouTube video shows
how CS can effect ordinary people. Featured is Dutch schoolteacher Hanny van Arkel
who is a friend who I have met with several times. She discovered
a rare astronomical object which is named after her. 

Certainly the quiz on this page needs some
knowledge of the studies linked to!

The eight academic studies are:
<div align="left">
    <ol>
        <li>"Describing Vocalizations in Young Children: A Big Data Approach Through Citizen Science Annotation."
        </li>
        <li>"Exploring the role of smartphone technology for citizen science in agriculture."
        </li>
        <li>"Millions of historical monthly rainfall observations taken in the UK and Ireland rescued by citizen scientists."
        </li>
        <li>"Of Scribes and Scripts: Citizen Science and the Cairo Genizah."
        </li>
        <li>"ForestEyes Project Citizen Science and Machine Learning to detect deforested areas in tropical forests."
        </li>
        <li>"Deep learning for automatic segmentation of the nuclear envelope in electron microscopy data, trained with volunteer segmentations."
        </li>
        <li>"Citizen science, computing, and conservation:How can “Crowd AI” change the way we tackle large-scale ecological challenges?"
        </li>
        <li>"Involving recreational snorkelers in inventory improvement or creation: a case study in the Indian Ocean."
        </li>
    </ol>

        </a>
</div>
The contacts page has a quiz that takes the user via a link
to the Wikipedia article "Citizen Science". This is a large article and the quiz is difficult,
which is a good way to introduce people to the larger picture.

There is also a Jotform should you wish to enquire more about any aspect of the website.

    <!--- testing -->
    
## Testing
The website was assembled using HTML5, CSS3 and JS2015. I used the desktop program Microsoft VS code and online Gitpod. I used Gitpod a lot more this time than in the previous project for clarity and to practise in a more professional setting. Code Beautify was used to tidy code and helped reveal poorly-executed code. The website was viewed with several android phones, Windows 10 laptops, an iPad and a 24" separate desktop screen. Three browsers Firefox, Chrome and MS Edge were checked.
My AIO desktop is an up-to-date Linux Ubuntu with a 24" screen. This displayed the images well, though some of the styling looked odd.

## Deployment

The website was deployed on the 16th April 2023 using GitHub pages. The site was found to be responsive and all links worked, including the image links to the data hosting site. Wireframes and development images were used to tweak layout, while two YouTube video links and four pictures that were found to reduce performance using Page Speed Insights were removed. 
   
## Validation
   
    <!--- end of validation --->
    <!--- wireframes --->
   
## Wireframes
Fifteen wireframes were made using the website Balsamiq. They encompassed iPhone, browser and iPad. Three are
shown below. As can be seen, while some pages have not changed much, others have lost videos or images,
mainly for performance issues.
