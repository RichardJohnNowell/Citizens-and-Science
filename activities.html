          There are many opportunities to take part in a citizen science project. Perhaps most well known is Zoonoverse.org which has over fifty projects available at the moment, 
          with up to and over 100 projects having been taking place. For armchair enthusiasts, these type of projects can be a great entry point and include diverse subjects such  
          as 'spider crab watch', 'getting to know medieaval londoners' or 'genome detectives'.
          </p>
          <p>
          Smartphones have increased the opportunities for citizen science a great deal.People are able to get out into the environment and take water sample readings, numerous 
          nature projects as well as being involved in 'citizen sensing', a form of science that hopes to measure, for example, urban pollution from people using wood stoves: 
          trendy but deadly!
          </p>
          <p>
          In the UK many of these are projects that children can enjoy, which can also help build awareness of our environment Perhaps reptile reporting (finding snakes) isn't 
          such a good move, but something simple like conker tree observations or bird counts can capture interest. many schools already have activities and lessons centred around 
          getting youngster involved with science.
